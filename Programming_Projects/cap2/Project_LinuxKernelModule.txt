Title: Programming project 1 -> Linux Kernel Module

Description: In this project we are going to write kernel code that will 
interact with the Linux kernel. It is important to use a virtual machine to 
avoid any further problem like crashing the system or corrupting something.
	The virtual machine that will be used in this project is: ???
The project will be divided in the following four parts.

I - Kernel Moduler Overview:
	- The command line 'lsmod' list all kernel modules that are currently 
	loaded;
	-The program 'simple.c' is a simple kernel module that illustrates the
	process of loading and unloading a kernel module;
	-The function 'printk()' is the kernel equivalent of 'printf()'. Its 
	output can be read by the 'dmesg' command;
	-Compile the 'simple.c' program using the Makefile with command 'make';
II - Loading and Removing Kernel Modules:
	-The command 'insmod' is used to load the module. In order to load the 
	kernel module 'simple.ko', the following command must be executed:
	Ex: "$ sudo insmod simple.ko" 
	-In order to remove a module from the kernel, use the command 'rmmod'.
	Ex: "$ sudo rmmod simple"
	OBS: Note that it is not necessary to use the suffix '.ko' when removing
	a kernel module.
	-To clean the kernel log message buffer, use: "$ sudo dmesg -c". This is
	useful to avoid that the buffer fills up;
