Question 3.18 - Write a C program that forks a child process that ultimately becomes 
a zombie process (defunct process of which parent did not have called wait). This combie 
process must remain in the system for at least 10 seconds.

Question 3.19 - Write a C program that determines the amount of time necessary to run a 
command from the command line. This program will run "./program_name <command>" and
will report the amount of elapsed time to run the specific command. This will involve 
using fork(), exec(), and gettimeofday() functions. It will also require the use of
two different IPC mechanisms.
