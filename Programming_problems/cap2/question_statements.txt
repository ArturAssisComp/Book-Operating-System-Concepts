Question 2.24 - Write a program that copies the contents of one file to a 
destination file by prompting the user for the name of the source and destination 
files. Write this program using either the POSIX or Windows API. Be sure to 
include all necessary error checking, including ensuring that the source file exists.
	Once you have correctly designed and tested the program, if you used a system 
that supports it, run the program using utility that traces system calls. (In Linux 
systems, use the command 'strace').
